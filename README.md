## Hi there üëã
## üëã About Me

I am a conservation-driven researcher with a deep-rooted passion for **wildlife conservation** and **habitat ecology**. My academic and field experiences have taken me across diverse and ecologically rich landscapes‚Äîranging from mangroves and estuaries to coastal ecosystems‚Äîwhere I have studied both habitats and species that are often at the intersection of ecological vulnerability and human interaction.

My journey into wildlife research began with a strong foundation in habitat ecology during my **M.Sc. in Wildlife Science** in India. My thesis focused on investigating the **spatial distribution patterns of Smooth-Coated Otters and Fishing Cats** in the mangrove and estuarine systems of **coastal Odisha**. Using **GIS** and **remote sensing tools**, I analyzed how anthropogenic disturbances shape the spatial ecology and behavior of these species. This work not only deepened my interest in landscape-level conservation but also highlighted the need for integrative approaches that combine ecological science with human dimensions.

Beyond field-based research, I have engaged with **local communities and State Forest Departments**, leading **awareness campaigns** and **capacity-building workshops** that aim to bridge the gap between scientific research and grassroots conservation. These experiences have reinforced my belief that effective conservation must be both **ecologically informed** and **socially grounded**.

Currently, my academic focus lies at the intersection of **spatial ecology**, **wildlife conservation**, and **community-based conservation models**. I am particularly motivated to explore research that integrates **ecological data with stakeholder perspectives**, ensuring that conservation outcomes are sustainable, inclusive, and grounded in local realities.

As I continue my doctoral journey, I am excited to further develop skills in advanced analytical tools such as **DNA metabarcoding**, remote sensing, and ecological modeling. My long-term goal is to contribute to interdisciplinary conservation science that supports **both biodiversity and community resilience** in a rapidly changing world.
